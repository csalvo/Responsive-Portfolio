		<p>Cristina was born and raised in a small town just 10 miles north of Boston. While she loved the northeast, in 2008 when she graduated high school, she moved to southwest Virginia, to attend college at Virginia Tech. There, after a struggle of finding a major, she graduated with a Bachelor's Degree in Business Information Techonology, a mix of business classes and computer science. 
		</p>

		<p>After graduating in 2012, she moved back to Boston and began her career working at a medical device compliance software company. After almost 3 years, it was time for a change, so down to Nashville, TN she went.  Working at a start up as a Quality Assurance Engineer was where she became inspired by her fellow software developers to want to write code. When the company unfortunately closed its doors, she moved back to Boston once again, and continued working at another company as QA Engineer, where she is still currently employed.
